# Shading Triangle - x86_64, AVX, AVX2, C++

Drawing shaded triangle (Gouraud shading). Project is written in two languages: C++ and x86_64 assembler (Intel syntax).

### C++
- window managment, interaction with user, drawing grid (background)...

### Assembler (x86_64, Intel syntax)
- function that is used for drawing shaded triangle
- floating point numbers were used for calculations 
- in order to optimize the program, coordinates and colors are calculated simultaneously (AVX, AVX2)
